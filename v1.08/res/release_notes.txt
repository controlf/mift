v1.08
- Tidier code

v1.07
- General bug fixes
- Improved logging system enabled. Log file now outputs to: /AppData/roaming/CF_SIFT/
- Temporary directory created at: /AppData/roaming/CF_SIFT/temp
  Working copies of files that are generated by Sift are stored here for processing.
- Dialog to allow users to select a save location for the reports

v1.06
- General bug fixes
- Found another database inside of PhotoData/CPL called cloud.storedb. A link can be made between the identifier here and the Master Fingerprint in the ZASSET table of photos.sqlite. Cloud.storedb contains a binary plist nested inside another binary plist which contains the name of the device that owns the cloud image (aka Primary Sync). Therefore, if the image has originated from the cloud, we can say which device name, belonging to an iCloud account, was responsible for uploading the image to the cloud.


v1.05
- General bug fixes


v1.04

- HTML Reports - For Sony, Samsung, Huawei and Apple Photos the HTML reports will now contain embedded src images. This saves porting the 'out' folder with the HTML report.

- Apple Photos.sqlite
Cloud Placeholder is given an index. Images with a 0 are low resolution and those with 4/5 are high resolution. This depends on user settings and whether the copies have been downloaded from the cloud or uploaded from the device. If the user has enabled low data settings, and the image originates from the cloud, the copy local to the handset will be a 0 (low resolution).

- Imported By [value 6] is also an import from Third Party. An image that is captured whilst using an App that has permission to use the camera will be marked as a 6. This was noted whilst capturing and sending an image using Discord.
- Imported By [value 0] appears to relate to images imported from the cloud. Images with a 0 for Imported By will be marked ~Cloud (~ indicated possibly)
