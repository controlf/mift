Cloud Placeholder is given an index. Images with a 0 are low resolution and those with 4/5 are high resolution. This depends on user settings and whether the copies have been downloaded from the cloud or uploaded from the device. If the user has enabled low data settings, and the image originates from the cloud, the copy local to the handset will be a 0 (low resolution).

- Imported By [value 6] is also an import from Third Party. An image that is captured whilst using an App that has permission to use the camera will be marked as a 6. This was noted whilst capturing and sending an image using Discord.
- Imported By [value 0] appears to relate to images imported from the cloud. Images with a 0 for Imported By will be marked ~Cloud (~ indicated possibly)
